# Code Review Improvements Demonstration
# This script demonstrates all the new features added based on the code review

echo "=== Code Review Improvements Demonstration ==="
echo ""

echo "1. ✅ W3C Trace Context Support"
echo "   - Logging middleware now accepts 'traceparent' header"
echo "   - Extracts trace ID from W3C traceparent format"
echo "   - Example:"
echo "     curl -H 'traceparent: 00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01' ..."
echo ""

echo "2. ✅ OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Tracing Integration"
echo "   - Added go.opentelemetry.io/otel v1.33.0"
echo "   - OTEL middleware automatically creates spans"
echo "   - Trace/Span IDs logged in structured logs"
echo "   - See: internal/middleware/logging.go"
echo ""

echo "3. ✅ User Count Metric Added"
echo "   - New Prometheus metric: users_total (gauge)"
echo "   - Automatically counts users in database"
echo "   - Available at /metrics endpoint"
echo "   - Example: curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep users_total"
echo ""

echo "4. ✅ Rate Limiting Middleware"
echo "   - Per-IP rate limiting: 100 req/s, burst 200"
echo "   - Returns HTTP 429 when limit exceeded"
echo "   - See: internal/middleware/ratelimit.go"
echo "   - Test: internal/middleware/ratelimit_test.go"
echo ""

echo "5. ✅ CORS Middleware"
echo "   - Added github.com/gin-contrib/cors v1.7.0"
echo "   - Configurable origins, methods, headers"
echo "   - Supports W3C trace headers (traceparent, tracestate)"
echo "   - See: internal/routes/routes.go"
echo ""

echo "6. ✅ API Versioning"
echo "   - New v1 API: /v1/login, /v1/users, /v1/users/{id}"
echo "   - Legacy endpoints maintained for backward compatibility"
echo "   - All new integrations should use v1 endpoints"
echo ""

echo "7. ✅ Enhanced bcrypt Security"
echo "   - Increased bcrypt cost factor from 10 to 12"
echo "   - Better security vs performance balance"
echo "   - See: pkg/utils/auth.go (BcryptCost = 12)"
echo ""

echo "8. ✅ Input Validation"
echo "   - All handlers use Gin validator tags"
echo "   - Request validation before processing"
echo "   - See handlers: internal/handlers/*.go"
