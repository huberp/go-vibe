# Issue 1
create_issue \
    "Enhance error handling and logging in authentication handler" \
    "## Description
The \`auth_handler.go\` file has opportunities for improved error handling and logging:
1. Database queries don't log errors before returning generic messages to clients
2. Missing structured logging for authentication attempts (success/failure)
3. No rate limiting context for login attempts

## Goals
- Add structured logging for all authentication events
- Log authentication failures with context (IP, email attempt, timestamp)
- Improve error messages returned to clients while maintaining security
- Add request context propagation

## Files to modify
- \`internal/handlers/auth_handler.go\`
- Add tests in \`internal/handlers/auth_handler_test.go\` (new file)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All database operations log errors with context
- [ ] Authentication attempts are logged (without passwords)
- [ ] Tests validate error scenarios
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs

**Priority**: High" \

# Issue 2
create_issue \
    "Add comprehensive tests for auth and user handlers" \
    "## Description
Current test coverage for handlers is 68.9%. Missing tests include:
1. No tests for \`auth_handler.go\` at all
2. Edge cases in user handler (concurrent updates, database failures)
3. Authorization logic for owner vs admin access

## Goals
- Create comprehensive test suite for auth handler
- Increase handler test coverage to >90%
- Test all error paths and edge cases
- Add integration tests for authorization logic

## Files to modify
- Create \`internal/handlers/auth_handler_test.go\`
- Enhance \`internal/handlers/user_handler_test.go\`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Auth handler has >90% test coverage
- [ ] User handler has >90% test coverage
- [ ] All error paths are tested
- [ ] Authorization edge cases are covered

# Issue 3
create_issue \
    "Improve test coverage for middleware components" \
    "## Description
Middleware test coverage is at 49.4%, with gaps in:
1. Logging middleware edge cases (invalid trace context, long paths)
2. Metrics middleware error scenarios
3. Rate limiting edge cases (burst capacity, multiple IPs)

## Goals
- Increase middleware test coverage to >85%
- Test all middleware error paths
- Add tests for middleware interaction/ordering
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Files to modify
- Enhance \`internal/middleware/logging_test.go\` (new file)
- Enhance \`internal/middleware/metrics_test.go\` (new file)
- Enhance existing middleware tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Middleware coverage >85%
- [ ] All error paths tested

# Issue 4
create_issue \
    "Implement owner access validation in user endpoints" \
    "## Description
The \`GetUserByID\` and \`UpdateUser\` endpoints are documented as \"Owner or Admin\" but don't validate that regular users can only access their own data:
1. Missing validation that user_id from JWT matches the resource ID
2. Admin users can access any user, but regular users should only access their own data
3. No tests validating this authorization logic

## Goals
- Add authorization middleware or handler logic to validate owner access
- Ensure regular users can only read/update their own profile
- Ensure admins can access any user
- Add comprehensive tests for authorization

## Files to modify
- \`internal/handlers/user_handler.go\` (add authorization checks)
- \`internal/handlers/user_handler_test.go\` (add authorization tests)
- Optionally create \`internal/middleware/authorization.go\` for reusable logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Regular users can only access their own profile
- [ ] Admins can access any profile
- [ ] Unauthorized access returns 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Tests validate all authorization scenarios

# Issue 5
create_issue \
    "Refactor duplicate route definitions for API versioning" \
    "## Description
In \`routes.go\`, there's significant code duplication between v1 routes and legacy routes (lines 99-140):
1. Same handlers registered twice
2. Same middleware applied twice
3. Maintenance burden when updating routes

## Goals
- Create a helper function to register routes once
- Remove duplication while maintaining backward compatibility
- Ensure tests cover both versioned and legacy routes

## Files to modify
- \`internal/routes/routes.go\`
- \`internal/routes/routes_test.go\`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Route registration logic is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Both v1 and legacy routes still work
- [ ] Tests validate both route versions
- [ ] Code is more maintainable

# Issue 6
create_issue \
    "Implement JWT token refresh endpoint and logic" \
    "## Description
Current JWT implementation has limitations:
1. Tokens expire after 24 hours with no refresh mechanism
2. Users must re-authenticate to get a new token
3. No \"remember me\" or refresh token functionality

## Goals
- Implement refresh token mechanism (optional refresh tokens)
- Add \`/v1/refresh\` endpoint
- Store refresh tokens securely (in database with expiration)
- Add tests for token refresh logic

## Files to modify
- Create \`internal/handlers/refresh_handler.go\`
- Add \`RefreshToken\` model to \`internal/models/\`
- Update \`pkg/utils/auth.go\` with refresh token generation
- Update \`internal/routes/routes.go\`
- Add tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Refresh token endpoint implemented
- [ ] Refresh tokens stored securely
- [ ] Old refresh tokens invalidated on use
- [ ] Comprehensive tests for refresh logic
- [ ] Documentation updated

# Issue 7
create_issue \
    "Enhance configuration loading with better error reporting" \
    "## Description
The configuration package has areas for improvement:
1. \`log.Fatalf\` in library code (\`config.go:99\`) violates best practices
2. Missing validation for required configuration values
3. No graceful handling of malformed YAML
4. Limited error context when configuration fails

## Goals
- Return errors instead of using \`log.Fatalf\`
- Validate required configuration fields
- Provide helpful error messages for configuration issues
- Add configuration validation tests

## Files to modify
- \`pkg/config/config.go\`
- \`pkg/config/config_test.go\`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No \`log.Fatalf\` in library code
- [ ] Required fields are validated
- [ ] Clear error messages for config issues
- [ ] Tests validate error cases
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing configs

# Issue 8
create_issue \
    "Expose database connection pool metrics to Prometheus" \
    "## Description
While database health checks exist, connection pool metrics aren't exposed:
1. No visibility into connection pool exhaustion
2. Can't monitor connection wait times
3. Missing metrics: active connections, idle connections, wait count, wait duration

## Goals
- Add Prometheus metrics for database connection pool stats
- Expose metrics like: open connections, in use, idle, wait count
- Add Grafana dashboard example in documentation
- Add tests for metrics collection

## Files to modify

# Issue 9
create_issue \
    "Add graceful shutdown for server and database connections" \
    "## Description
The main server doesn't implement graceful shutdown:
1. Server stops immediately when receiving SIGTERM/SIGINT
2. In-flight requests may be terminated abruptly
3. Database connections aren't closed cleanly
4. No timeout for shutdown operations

## Goals
- Implement graceful shutdown with signal handling
- Allow in-flight requests to complete (with timeout)
- Close database connections cleanly
- Add shutdown timeout configuration
- Add tests for shutdown behavior

## Files to modify
- \`cmd/server/main.go\`
- Add shutdown tests

## Acceptance Criteria

# Issue 10
create_issue \
    "Create comprehensive API validation rules documentation" \
    "## Description
While Swagger docs exist, validation rules aren't fully documented:
1. No clear documentation of validation rules (min/max lengths, formats)
2. Error responses for validation failures aren't documented
3. Examples don't show validation error responses

## Goals
- Document all validation rules in Swagger annotations
- Add examples of validation error responses
- Create API validation guide in docs
